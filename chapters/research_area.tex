\section*{About}

 {
  Arch. Ariel Noyman, PhD, is an urban scientist at the intersection of cities and technology. His research develops novel methods for urban modeling, simulation, and~\textbf{the democratization of data-driven design processes}. He has led and co-founded a global network of City Science Living Labs, bringing research into direct dialogue with real-world urban challenges. Noyman's work has been recognized with awards from the European Commission, OECD, and global governments; it has been featured in The Guardian, 60 Minutes, and The New York Times, and showcased in exhibitions, conferences, and summits worldwide. Currently, Noyman is a Research Scientist at the MIT City Science Group; He conducted studios and lectured seminars and workshops on design and urban technology at MIT, Cornell, Northeastern, and Bezalel. Before joining MIT, Noyman practiced architecture, urban design and planning for over a decade in the US, EU, and the ME. Noyman holds a P.h.D and M.S. from MIT, and a B.Arch (cum laude) from Bezalel Academy.
