\section*{About}

 {
  Arch. Ariel Noyman PhD, is an urban scientist, working in the intersection of cities and technology. His research is on novel methods of urban modeling and simulation, and the \textbf{democratization of data-driven design processes}. Noyman led and helped establish a worldwide network of City Science Living-Labs, in Hamburg, Andorra, Shanghai, Helsinki, and most recently in the Negev, in an effort to confront his research with real-world challenges. Noyman's work received awards from the European Commission, the OECD, the Chinese and the Israeli Gov., was featured by The Guardian, 60 Minutes, The New York Times and was displayed in exhibitions, conferences and summits worldwide. Today, Noyman is a Research Scientist at the MIT City Science Group, and a lecturer at MIT, Northeastern University, and Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem. Before coming to MIT, Noyman practiced architecture, urban design, and city planning for over a decade in the US and EMEA. Noyman holds a PhD and a Master of Science from MIT, and a Bachelor in Architecture (cum Laude) from Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem.
